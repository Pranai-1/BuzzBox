 It's important to understand how the `socket.on()` event listeners work in the context of a socket connection.

In the case of a socket.io connection, the `socket.on()` event listeners are set up to listen for specific events sent from The
 server over the WebSocket connection. When the server emits an event with a specific name (e.g., "getMessage" or "getOnlineUsers"),
  the corresponding `socket.on()` event listener on the client is triggered.

Here's how it works:

1. The client establishes a WebSocket connection to the server using `socket.io`. This connection is persistent and allows for 
real-time communication.

2. The server and client can both emit events over this WebSocket connection. When the server emits an event with a specific name 
(e.g., "getMessage"), it sends that event to all connected clients.

3. On the client side, you use `socket.on()` to set up event listeners to listen for specific events from the server. 
For example, you use `socket.on("getMessage", ...)` to listen for the "getMessage" event.

4. When the server emits the "getMessage" event, all connected clients, including the one that set up the `socket.on("getMessage", ...)
 listener, will receive the event.

5. The callback function specified in `socket.on("getMessage", ...)` is executed when the "getMessage" event is received by the client. This allows you to handle the data sent by the server in response to that event.

Regarding the `useEffect` with the `socket` dependency, the `useEffect` is triggered whenever the `socket` dependency changes.
 This can happen when the component is first mounted, or if `socket` changes due to some other action in your application.
  When the `socket` changes, the `useEffect` sets up the event listeners (e.g., `socket.on("getMessage", ...)`) 
  if `socket` is available. This is why the event listeners are set up when the component mounts and also whenever `socket` changes.

In summary, `socket.on()` event listeners are triggered when the server emits events with matching names. 
The `socket` dependency in the `useEffect` ensures that the event listeners are set up or updated whenever the `socket` changes, 
allowing your client to receive and respond to events emitted by the server in real-time.


`socket.on()` event listeners are set up to listen for specific events on the socket connection, and they will be called whenever
the corresponding event is emitted by the server, regardless of whether the dependencies of a `useEffect` change.

In the context of a `useEffect`, the primary purpose of specifying dependencies is to determine when the `useEffect` itself should 
run or re-run. If any of the listed dependencies change, the `useEffect` is triggered.

However, the event listeners established with `socket.on()` are not dependent on the `useEffect` or its dependencies. They are 
established once and continue to listen for events as long as the socket connection is open. These event listeners will respond 
to the emitted events from the server independently of whether the `useEffect` is re-run due to changes in its dependencies.

So, you are correct: `socket.on()` will be called whenever the corresponding event is emitted by the server, and it is not directly
 tied to changes in the dependencies of a specific `useEffect`.
